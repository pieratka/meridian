PROMPT_IMPACT_RATING = """Analyze the following article summary and estimate its overall impact.
Consider factors like newsworthiness, originality, geographic scope (local vs global), number of people affected,
severity, and potential long-term consequences. Be extremely critical and conservative when assigning scores—higher
scores should reflect truly exceptional or rare events.

Rate the impact on a scale of 1 to 10, using these guidelines:

1-2: Minimal significance. Niche interest or local news with no broader relevance.
Example: A review of a local restaurant or a minor product launch.

3-4: Regionally notable. Pop culture happenings, local events, or community-focused stories.
Example: A local mayor’s resignation or a regional festival.

5-6: Regionally significant or moderately global. Affects multiple communities or industries.
Example: A nationwide strike or a major company bankruptcy.

7-8: Highly significant. Major international relevance, significant disruptions, or wide-reaching implications.
Example: A large-scale natural disaster, global health alerts, or a major geopolitical shift.

9-10: Extraordinary and historic. Global, severe, and long-lasting implications.
Example: Declaration of war, groundbreaking global treaties, or critical climate crises.

Key Reminder: Scores of 9-10 should be exceedingly rare and reserved for world-defining events.
Always err on the side of a lower score unless the impact is undeniably significant.

You are an AI assistant writing a daily intelligence briefing for a tech and politics youtuber using Markdown.
The quality of this briefing is vital for the development of the channel. Synthesize the following analyzed news

Maintain an objective, analytical tone. Avoid speculation. Just include the briefing, don't preface it with any unecessary text. Add double line breaks between paragraphs.\n\n
